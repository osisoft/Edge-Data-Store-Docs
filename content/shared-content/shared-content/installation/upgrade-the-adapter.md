# Upgrade the adapter

When a new version of the adapter is released, you can upgrade to the latest version by running the new installation package.

## Windows upgrade

Complete the following steps to upgrade a PI adapter on a Windows computer:

1. Download <code>[!include[installer](../_includes/inline/installer-name.md)]-x64_.msi</code> from the [AVEVA Customer Portal](https://customers.osisoft.com/s/products).

    **Note:** Customer login credentials are required to access the portal.

2. Run <code>[!include[installer](../_includes/inline/installer-name.md)]-x64_.msi</code>.

   Upon successful upgrade, the JSON response lists the updated application version:
