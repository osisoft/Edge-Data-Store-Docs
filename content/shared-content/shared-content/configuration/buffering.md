# Buffering

You can configure PI adapters to buffer data egressed from the adapter to endpoints. Configure buffering through the buffering configuration parameters in the system configuration.

**Note:** OSIsoft recommends that you do not modify the default buffering location unless it is necessary. Changes to the buffering configuration parameters only take effect during adapter service startup.

## Configure buffering

Complete the following steps to configure buffering. Use the `PUT` method in conjunction with the `http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/buffering` REST endpoint to initialize the configuration.

1. Using a text editor, create an empty text file.

2. Copy and paste an example configuration for buffering into the file.

    For sample JSON, see [Examples - Retrieve the buffering configuration](#examples).

3. Update the example JSON parameters for your environment.

    For a table of all available parameters, see [Buffering parameters](#buffering-parameters).

4. Save the file. For example, as `ConfigureBuffering.json`.

5. Open a command line session. Change directory to the location of `ConfigureBuffering.json`.

6. Enter the following cURL command (which uses the `PUT` method) to initialize the buffering configuration.

    ```bash
    curl -d "@ConfigureBuffering.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/buffering"
    ```

**Note:** If you installed the adapter to listen on a non-default port, update `5590` to the port number in use. For a list of other REST operations you can perform, like updating or replacing a buffering configuration, see [REST URLs](#rest-urls).

## Buffering schema

The full schema definition for the system buffering is in the `System_Buffering_schema.json` file located in one of the following folders:

* **Windows**: `%ProgramFiles%\OSIsoft\Adapters\<AdapterName>\Schemas`

* **Linux**: `/opt/OSIsoft/Adapters/<AdapterName>/Schemas`

## Buffering parameters

The following parameters are available for configuring buffering:

| Parameter | Required | Type | Description |
| ----------| -------- | ---- | ----------- |
| **EnablePersistentBuffering**  | Optional |  `boolean` | Enables or disables on-disk buffering <br><br> Allowed value: `true` or `false`<br>Default value: `true` <br><br> **Note:** If you disable persistent buffering, in-memory buffering is used. On-disk and in-memory buffering are limited by value in the **MaxBufferSizeMB** property. |
| **MaxBufferSizeMB**  | Optional     |`integer` | Defines the maximum size of the buffer that is persisted on disk <sup>1</sup> or used in memory <sup>2</sup>. The unit is specified in MB (1 Megabyte = 1048576 bytes). Consider the capacity and the type of storage medium to determine a suitable value for this parameter. <br><br>Minimum value: `1`<br>Maximum value:  `2147483647`<br> Default value: `1024`<br><br>**Note:** The **MaxBufferSizeMB** property is applied to each configured endpoint. For example, if you set the **MaxBufferSizeMB** to `1024` and  you configured the adapter to send data to two endpoints (for example, AVEVA Server and AVEVA Data Hub), the total maximum resources used for buffering will be `2048`.  The health endpoint is an exception fixed at 20 MB.  |
| **BufferLocation**   | Required  | `string` | Defines the location of the buffer files. Absolute paths are required. Consider the access-control list (ACL) when you set this parameter. **BufferLocation** is used to buffer files when **EnablePersistentBuffering** is `true`. <br><br> Allowed value: Valid path to a folder location in the file system <br> Default value: <br> **Windows:** _%ProgramData%\OSIsoft\Adapters\\{AdapterInstance}\Buffers_ <br> **Linux:** _/usr/share/OSIsoft/Adapters/{AdapterInstance}/Buffers_ |

<sup>1</sup> **Buffering to disk** - disk is only used if required; <br>

- Data is only written to the disk buffer if it is queued in the memory buffer for more than 5 seconds.
- The **MaxBufferSizeMB** is applied per configured endpoint, except the health endpoint.<br>
- An adapter creates 20 MB buffer files that are stored in **BufferLocation**.<br>
- When **MaxBufferSizeMB** is reached, the oldest buffer file is deleted and a new buffer file is created.<br>
- The health endpoint is fixed at 20 MB. When the health endpoint buffer file becomes full, a new buffer file is created and the previous buffer file is deleted.

**Note:** The following rules apply in case of an error when creating a new buffer file:

- Attempt to delete oldest buffer file and retry.
- If unable to buffer, errors are logged to indicate data loss.
- If a buffer file is corrupted, an attempt is made to recover individual records and any failure to recover records is logged.

<sup>2</sup> **Buffering only to memory**:<br>

- The **MaxBufferSizeMB** is applied per configured endpoint except the health endpoint.<br>
- When **MaxBufferSizeMB** is reached, the oldest messages in the memory buffer are removed. Depending on the size of a new message, several old messages may be removed.<br>
- The health endpoint is fixed at 20 MB. When the health endpoint buffer file becomes full, the oldest messages in the memory buffer are removed and new messages are added.

## Examples

The following examples are buffering configurations made through the`curl` REST client.

### Retrieve the buffering configuration

```cmd
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/buffering"
```

Sample output:

```code
{
    "bufferLocation": "C:/ProgramData/OSIsoft/Adapters/<AdapterName>/Buffers",
    "maxBufferSizeMB": 1024,
    "enablePersistentBuffering": true
}
```

`200 OK` response indicates success.

### Update MaxBufferSizeMb parameter

```cmd
curl -d "{ \"MaxBufferSizeMB\": 100 }" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PATCH "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/system/buffering"
```

`204 No Content` response indicates success.
