# On-demand history recovery configuration

The AVEVA Adapter supports performing history recovery on-demand by specifying a start and end time.

## Configure history recovery

1. Start any of the [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) capable of making HTTP requests.
2. Run a `POST` command with the `Id` of the history recovery and the `startTime` and `endTime` to the following endpoint: `http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/HistoryRecoveries`.

    Example using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -d "{ \"Id\":\"TestRecovery\", \"startTime\":\"2021-03-29T14:00:30Z\", \"endTime\":\"2021-03-29T15:00:15Z\"  }" -X POST "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/HistoryRecoveries"
    ```

**Note:** The default port is `5590`. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value. If you do not specify an `Id`, the endpoint generates a unique `Id`.

## History recovery parameters

Parameter | Type| Description
---------|----------|---------
 **Id** | `string` | The `Id` of the history recovery<br><br> **Note:** You cannot run multiple history recoveries with the same `Id`.
 **StartTime** | `datetime` | Time when the the first data items are collected
 **EndTime** | `datetime`| Time when the last data items are collected
| **Checkpoint** | `datetime` | The latest timestamp that the history recovery has completed with the range being between **startTime** and **endTime**
| **Items** | `double` | The amount of data selection items in the history recovery operation
| **RecoveredEvents** | `double` | Number of events that the history recovery found on the data source
| **Progress** | `double` | Progress of the history recovery (number of data items found through the history recovery)
| **Status** | `enum` | Status of the history recovery.<br><br>The following statuses are available:<br> - *Active* - The operation is currently in progress.<br>- *Complete* - The operation has been completed.<br>- *Canceled* - The operation has been canceled.<br>- *Failed* - The operation failed.
| **Errors** | `string` | Errors encountered during the history recovery

## History recovery status example

```json
[
 { 
   "Id": "HistoryRecovery1", 
   "StartTime": "2021-01-09T05:55:00.0", 
   "EndTime": "2021-01-26T13:20:00.0", 
   "CheckPoint": "2021-01-13T14:55:00.0", 
   "Items": 7000, 
   "RecoveredEvents": 800000, 
   "Progress": 20, 
   "Status": "Active", 
   "Errors": null 
 }
] 
```

**Note:** The result of the history recovery operation is added to the `<componentId>_historyRecoveries.json` file.
