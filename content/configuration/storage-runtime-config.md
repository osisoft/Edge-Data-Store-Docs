# Storage runtime configuration

The Edge Data Store storage component is installed with default configurations that are sufficient for most scenarios; however, you can configure the runtime characteristics of the storage component.  

**Note:** Consult with Technical Support before you modify the default configuration.

To update the storage runtime configuration:

1. Using any text editor, create a JSON file that contains the storage runtime configuration.

  - For the content structure, see [Parameters](#parameters).

2. Save the JSON file with the name `Storage_Runtime.config.json`.

3. From the same directory where the file exists, run the following `curl` script:

  ```bash
  curl -d "@Storage_Runtime.config.json" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X PUT http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/storage/Runtime
  ```

  **Note:** The @ symbol is a required prefix for this command.

## Parameters

The following table lists all available runtime parameters for EDS storage configuration.

| Parameter                       | Required | Type     | Description                                        |
|---------------------------------|----------|----------|----------------------------------------------------|
| [IngressDebugExpiration](#ingressdebugexpiration)      | Required | string   | If set, defines how long OMF ingress debug files should be produced |
| [StreamStorageLimitMb](#streamstoragelimitmb)        | Required | integer  | The maximum size in megabytes that a stream can reach |
| [StreamStorageTargetMb](#streamstoragetargetmb)       | Required | integer  | The size in megabytes that a stream will be reduced to after StreamStorageLimitMb size is reached for a single stream |
| [TransactionLogLimitMB](#transactionloglimitmb)     | No       | integer  | Maximum size for transaction log file. Transaction log files larger than this size will be deleted, resulting is loss of data should the device lose power. |
| [CheckpointRateInSec](#checkpointrateinsec)         | No       | integer  | How often to flush new data to store  |

## Examples

The following is a valid runtime configuration example.

```
{
  "streamStorageLimitMb": 2,
  "streamStorageTargetMb": 1,
  "ingressDebugExpiration": "0001-01-01T00:00:00",
  "checkpointRateInSec": 30,
  "transactionLogLimitMB": 250
}
```

## IngressDebugExpiration

Use the `IngressDebugExpiration` property to set the date and time when debugging should be disabled. If you specify a future date and time, incoming OMF messages are logged and the HTTP request and response content is stored to disk for review. The debug logging stops at the date and time specified. Set the value to `null` to disable logging.

Every incoming OMF message logs a request and response log file. Log files are located in the following location and grouped by the associated OMF message type:

`C:\ProgramData\OSIsoft\EdgeDataStore\Logs\IngressDebugLogs\`

Each log file leverages the following filename format:

`{ticks}-{operationId}-{Request/Response}.txt`

The following examples are valid strings representing date and time:

  - UTC: "yyyy-mm-ddThh:mm:ssZ"

  - Local: "mm-dd-yyyy hh:mm:ss"

When you activate logging, the content of an incoming OMF message, including the headers, is written to multiple files in the `Logs` directory. Those files are written to the `IngressDebugLogs` directory in the usual logs directory for every incoming OMF type, container, and data message.

### IngressDebugExpiration type

`string`

- format: `date-time` date and time (according to [RFC 3339, section 5.6](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339))

- minimum length: 1 character

## StreamStorageLimitMb

Use the `StreamStorageLimitMb` property to set the maximum size in megabytes that a stream can reach. When a stream exceeds the specified size, older data is deleted from the file until the stream is at or below the `StreamStorageTargetMb` value. The target value, set in the `StreamStorageTargetMb` property, needs to be smaller than the maximum specified in this property.

### StreamStorageLimitMb type

`integer`

- minimum value: `2`
- maximum value: `2147483647`

## StreamStorageTargetMb

Use the `StreamStorageTargetMb` property to set the size in megabytes that a stream is reduced to after `StreamStorageLimitMb` size is reached for a single stream. When a stream exceeds the size specified in the `StreamStorageLimitMb` property, older data is deleted from the file until the stream is at or below the `StreamStorageTargetMb` value. The target value needs to be smaller than the maximum specified in the `StreamStorageLimitMb` property.

### StreamStorageTargetMb type

`integer`

- minimum value: `1`
- maximum value: `2147483647`

## TransactionLogLimitMB

Use the `TransactionLogLimitMB` property to define the maximum size, in MB, of a transaction log. When a transaction log exceeds this size, it is deleted, which reduces the amount of data that you can recover if the host device loses power.

### TransactionLogLimitMB type

`integer`

- minimum value: `1`
- maximum value: `2147483647`

## CheckpointRateInSec

Use the `CheckpointRateInSec` property to define, in seconds, how often the storage component ensures recent data and configuration changes are flushed to storage.  

A setting of `0` disables checkpointing. Disabling checkpointing reduces the resiliency of the product, which can result in data loss if the host device loses power.

### CheckpointRateInSec type

`integer`

- minimum value: `0`
- maximum value: `86400`
