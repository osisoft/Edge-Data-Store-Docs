# Egress execution details

After you configure a valid periodic or manual egress, selected data will be transferred to the referenced endpoint on the defined schedule, independently of other egress instances.

**Note:** EDS can only egress streams with a single timeseries-based index.

EDS uses OMF messages to egress data, and knowing how those messages are constructed can help with understanding how data is egressed. OMF defines three types of messages: types, containers, and data. Types and containers define the data being egressed and data is the actual timeseries data. For EDS, types and containers are sent only on the first egress for an endpoint; subsequently, only new or changed types and containers are egressed. Types are created first; then containers are created based on types; and then, data is egressed to containers. If type creation fails with a `HttpStatusCode Conflict (403)`, EDS will still try to egress the related containers. Container creation must be successful for data to be egressed.

Type, container, and data items are batched into one or more OMF messages for egress. Per the requirements defined in the OMF specification, a single message cannot exceed 192KB in size. Compression is automatically applied to outbound egress messages. On the destination, failure to add a single item results in the message failing. In that case, Edge Data Store egresses each item individually, per type or stream (that is each type, each stream, all collected data for a single stream). Types, containers, and data will continue to be egressed as long as the destination continues to respond to HTTP requests - retrying previous failures as needed.

If _periodic_ egress fails due to HTTP exceptions, EDS will retry sending the request with a default backoff. If EDS receives a `Retry-After` header in the response from the endpoint, then the backoff is adjusted accordingly. If the message still fails to send after retries, EDS will either move onto the next message in the queue or wait for 5 minutes before retrying process again.

If _manual_ egress fails due to HTTP exceptions, EDS will stop the egress instance and start the next manual egress in the queue.

For data collection and egress, in-memory and on-disk storage are used to track the last successfully-egressed data event per stream. EDS egresses data in the order it is collected and egress configurations can include future data.

**Note:** When EDS successfully egresses an event with a future timestamp, only values after the associated timestamp of that event are egressed.
