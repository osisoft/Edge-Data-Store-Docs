# Prepare egress destinations

AVEVA Data Hub and PI Server destinations require additional configuration to receive OMF messages.

## AVEVA Data Hub destinations

To prepare AVEVA Data Hub to receive OMF messages from EDS, create an OMF connection in AVEVA Data Hub. Creating an OMF connection results in an available OMF endpoint that EDS can use for the egress mechanism.

To create an OMF connection to AVEVA Data Hub:

1. In AVEVA Data Hub, create a client. For details, see [Clients](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/data-hub/page/set-up/clients/clients-concept.html) in the AVEVA Data Hub documentation.
   
  The **Client Id** and **Client Secret** are used for the corresponding properties in the `EgressEndpoints` configuration.
   
1. In AVEVA Data Hub, create an OMF connection. For details, see [Configure an OMF connection](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/data-hub/page/add-organize-data/collect-data/connectors/omf/omf-connection-procedure.html) in the AVEVA Data Hub documentation.
  
  The **OMF Endpoint** URL for the connection is used as the `EgressEndpoints` configuration **Endpoint** parameter.

## PI Server destinations

To prepare a PI Server to receive OMF messages from EDS, a PI Web API OMF endpoint must be available to be used as the `EgressEndpoints` configuration **Endpoint** parameter.

To create an OMF connection to PI Server:

1. Install PI Web API and enable the **OSIsoft Message Format (OMF) Services** feature.

   - During configuration, choose an AF database and PI Data Archive where metadata and data will be stored.
    
   - **Username** and **Password** are used in the `EgressEndpoints` configuration to connect to the PI Server. The referenced account needs permissions to create AF elements, element templates, and PI points.

1. Configure PI Web API to use `Basic` authentication.

 For complete steps, as well as best practices and recommendations, see the [PI Web API User Guide](https://docs.osisoft.com/bundle/pi-web-api/page/pi-web-api.html).

**Note:** The certificate used by PI Web API must be trusted by the device running EDS, otherwise the `EgressEndpoints` configuration `ValidateEndpointCertificate` property needs to be set to `false`. This can be the case with a **self-signed certificate**, which should only be used for testing purposes.

**Note:** To continue to send OMF egress messages to the PI Web API endpoint after upgrading PI Web API, restart the EDS service.
