# `content/modbus/shared-content` subtree

All content in this directory is consumed from the [AVEVA Adapter Modbus Docs](https://github.com/osisoft/AVEVA-Adapter-Modbus-Docs) repository as a subtree. This repo contains the unique Modbus documents used in EDS. Note that the Modbus document also makes use of the AVEVA Adapter framework documents stored in `content/shared-content`.
