# On-demand history recovery configuration

The PI adapter supports performing history recovery on-demand by specifying start and end time.

## Configure history recovery

1. Start any of the [Configuration tools](xref:ConfigurationTools) capable of making HTTP requests.
2. Run a `POST` command with the `Id` of the history recovery, and the `startTime` and `endTime` to the following endpoint: `http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/HistoryRecoveries`.

    Example using `curl`:

    ```bash
    curl -d "{ \"Id\":\"TestRecovery\", \"startTime\":\"2021-03-29T14:00:30Z\", \"endTime\":\"2021-03-29T15:00:15Z\"  }" -X POST "http://localhost:5590/api/v1/configuration/<ComponentId>/HistoryRecoveries"
    ```

    **Note:**

    - `5590` is the default port number. If you selected a different port number, replace it with that value.
    - If you do not specify an Id, the endpoint generates a unique Id.
